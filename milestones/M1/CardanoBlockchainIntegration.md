# Cardano Blockchain Integration Architecture Overview

## Project Overview
Our project aims to revolutionize agricultural investments by tokenizing agricultural profits and providing transparent, verifiable returns to investors. By leveraging Cardano's blockchain capabilities, we ensure secure transactions, robust identity management, and efficient data retrieval, all crucial for the project's success. 

**Note**: This project is in the concept phase, meaning all components and features are in development and will be tested on the Cardano testnet.


## Technology Introduction

### Blockfrost API
Blockfrost is a comprehensive API service for interacting with the Cardano blockchain. It provides essential functionalities for both data retrieval and transaction submissions, making it a cornerstone of our backend infrastructure.

**Features**:
- **REST API**: An easy-to-use RESTful API that allows developers to query transactions, addresses, blocks, and various blockchain metrics.
- **Scalability**: Handles requests at scale, offering high availability and consistent performance, crucial for production environments.
- **Security**: Provides secure API access with authentication tokens, ensuring data integrity and preventing unauthorized access.

**Usage**:
- **Setup**: Register on Blockfrost, obtain an API token, and configure it within your application.
- **API Calls**: Use the API to fetch necessary blockchain data, such as transaction histories or token balances.
- **Transaction Handling**: Submit transactions for token purchases, investments, and profit distributions.
- **Data Processing**: Integrate fetched data into your application logic, such as displaying balances or processing transactions.

**Pros**:
- Quick setup and easy integration.
- High scalability and availability.
- Secure and reliable.

**Cons**:
- As a SaaS, Blockfrost offers a free tier, but incurs costs after significant usage.

**Similar Options**:
- [Koios](https://www.koios.rest/pricing/Pricing.html)
- [Gomaestro](https://www.gomaestro.org/pricing)

**Long-term Strategy**:
While we are starting with Blockfrost for its speed and ease of setup, our long-term vision includes transitioning to an open-source solution like Ogmios to gain greater control over our data management and foster community contributions.

### Atala PRISM
[Atala PRISM](https://docs.atalaprism.io/docs/getting-started/) provides a robust infrastructure for decentralized identity management. It is crucial for ensuring secure and verifiable identities for all stakeholders involved in our project, enhancing trust and transparency.

**Components**:
- **Cloud Agent**: Manages DIDs and VCs, providing functionalities like authentication, authorization, credential issuance, and secure communication.
- **Wallet SDK**: Manages user credentials and interactions within the application.
- **Mediator**: Provides a way to send DIDComm messages between Edge Agent and Cloud Agent, enabling offline communication.
- **Edge Agent**: Acts as the interface between the Wallet SDK and the Mediator.
- **Open Enterprise Agent**: Facilitates secure operations for issuers and verifiers.

**Functions**:
- **Authentication and Authorization**: Ensures only authorized users can access the system.
- **DID Management**: Manages creation, updating, storing, and using DIDs.
- **Credential Issuance and Verification**: Handles the issuance and verification of credentials.
- **Secure Communication**: Manages secure communication using DIDComm.

**Deployment**:
- Deploy the Cloud Agent on a secure server or cloud instance (e.g., AWS, Azure, Google Cloud).

### MeshJS
MeshJS is a JavaScript library designed to facilitate interactions with the Cardano blockchain from the frontend. It simplifies wallet management and transaction operations, making it easier for users to interact with the blockchain directly from their browsers.

**Features**:
- **Wallet Creation and Management**: Allows users to create and manage their wallets within the application interface.
- **Transaction Management**: Facilitates the creation, signing, and submission of transactions.
- **Security**: Implements robust security measures to protect user data and credentials.

**Usage**:
- **Library Setup**: Include MeshJS in the project, configured for interaction with Cardano's blockchain.
- **User Interface**: Using React and TypeScript to build intuitive interfaces for wallet management and transaction operations.
- **Interaction Handling**: Utilize MeshJS utilities for blockchain interactions.
